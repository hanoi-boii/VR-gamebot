# VR-gamebot

Skills: Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Audio-Speech Processing, CSS, JavaScript, API deployment

VR-gamebot was a co-curricular group activity conducted with a few of my peers and seniors. Our concept involved developing a VR-based open-world environment with interactive characters and gaming quests. The team was divided into specialized groups responsible for creating the VR environment, modeling playable characters and NPCs, using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning to make the characters interactive, managing the database, and hosting all components on a server.  


My role involved developing and deploying ML models for user interaction with non-playable characters (NPCs). These NPCs could process audio inputs and provide appropriate responses to user queries, small talk, game quests, and directions. As such, I've uploaded all the API creation files along with the necessary add-ons of the dataset, ML models, css-js files.  

I planned to deploy these characters using Reinforcement Learning models next, but the global pandemic put these plans and the final integration of all factions on hold.
